# The Data
This folder contains all the astronomical data used in the paper. The subfolders fv, gvmin contain the results of computations of the speed distribution and the mean inverse speed respectively.

## Summary
* `Gaia-SDSS.csv` - Is the complete sample of halo stars from the Gaia-SDSS data.
* `Gaia-SDSS_local_2kpc.csv` - Are only those stars on orbits that are within 2 kpc of Earth at their closest point
* `Gaia-SDSS_local_1kpc.csv` - Same but for 1 kpc
* `Gaia-SDSS_local_0.5kpc.csv` - Same but for 0.5 kpc
* `GAIA-SDSS_Footprint_XZ.txt` - Is the footprint of the data in the Galactocentric X-Z plane
* `GAIA-SDSS_Footprint_XY.txt` - Is the same in the X-Y plane
* `GAIA_SDSS_Shardsless.csv` - Is the Gaia-SDSS Sample with the substructures removed
* `GAIA_SDSS_Shards.csv` - Are the substructures found in the Gaia-SDSS sample.
* `GAIA_SDSS_Shards_HaloCleaned.csv` - Are the substructures with potential contamination by the Sausage and the Disk cleaned
* `FitShards_red.csv` - Are the summarised fit properties of each substructure, accounting for potential wrappings around the Galaxy
* `FitShards_text.csv` - The Fit Shards data used to create a Latex table of the results
