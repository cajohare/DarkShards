# f(v) distributions
first row contains the values of v below which are 365 rows of g(v_min) for each day of the year starting Jan1. Each file has a version with '_GF' which is identical to the version without that label but accounts for the effect of gravitational focusing. The files correspond to each component of the halo model:

## fv_Halo.txt
Is the speed distribution of the isotropic halo with v_0 = 238 km/s and v_esc = 528 km/s

## fv_Saus.txt
Is the speed distribution of Sausage with beta = 0.9, v_0 = 238 km/s and v_esc = 528 km/s

## fv_Shards.txt
Is the summed speed distribution of the Shards which contains S1 and S2 streams, the retrograde and prograde tails, and 30 low-energy substructures. All are weighted by their population and the proximity of their orbits to Earth.
